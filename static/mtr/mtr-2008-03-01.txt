MAGIC: THE GATHERING® DCI FLOOR RULES
Effective Mar 1, 2008

Introduction
The Magic: The Gathering DCI® Floor Rules work in conjunction with the DCI Universal Tournament Rules (UTR), the DCI Penalty Guidelines, and the Magic™ game rules. Players, spectators, and tournament officials must follow these documents while involved with DCI-sanctioned Magic tournaments. Individuals who violate provisions of these documents will be subject to the appropriate provisions of the DCI Penalty Guidelines.

See Appendix A for a list of the changes from previous versions of this document.

See Appendix B of the DCI Universal Tournament Rules for definitions of terms in this document.

This document is published in multiple languages. If a discrepancy exists between the English version and a non-English version of this document, tournament participants must refer to the English version to settle disputes concerning floor rule interpretations.

This document is updated regularly. Please visit thedci.com/docs for the most current version.


100.	GENERAL MAGIC: THE GATHERING TOURNAMENT RULES

101.	Format and Ratings Categories
The DCI sanctions the following formats as individual, two-person team, three-person team, or multiplayer tournaments:

Constructed Formats
•	Standard
•	Extended
•	Block 

Eternal Formats
•	Vintage
•	Legacy

Limited Formats
•	Sealed Deck
•	Booster Draft (individual and multiplayer only)
•	Rochester Draft (individual and three-person team only)

The DCI produces the following ratings categories:
•	Constructed (includes all Standard, Extended, and Block individual matches)
•	Eternal (includes all Vintage and Legacy individual matches)
•	Limited (includes all Limited individual matches)
•	Team Constructed (includes all Constructed team matches)
•	Team Limited (includes all Limited team matches)
•	Multiplayer (see below)
	
In the team tournaments listed above, each team member plays a one-on-one match against a member of the other team, and the results comprise the teams’ match result. In a multiplayer tournament, on the other hand, all players from the two teams would play in the same game.

Event results for all for two-person multiplayer tournaments will eventually be merged into a single Multiplayer rating. Multiplayer ratings and rankings will available at a date to be announced in a future version of this document.

102.	Authorized Cards
Alpha cards (cards from the first print run of the core set) may be used in decks containing non-Alpha cards only if all cards are placed in completely opaque sleeves and only if the sleeves could not be considered marked. If sleeves are not used, Alpha cards may be used only in decks that consist exclusively of Alpha cards.

Participants may not use cards from special sets or supplements with alternate backs, squared corners or gold borders. (Examples: Collector’s Edition, Pro Tour Collector’s Set, World Championship decks.) Players may not use silver-bordered Unglued™ or Unhinged™ cards. Unglued and Unhinged basic land cards are allowed in sanctioned Magic tournaments.

Players may use cards from special sets and supplements with black- or white-bordered cards published by Wizards of the Coast that do not have alternate backs and/or squared corners. (Examples: the Anthologies™, Beatdown™, and Battle Royale™ box sets). However, the card(s) must be otherwise legal to play in that tournament’s format.

A series of official promotional cards called textless spells are allowed in DCI-sanctioned Magic tournaments. However, the card(s) must otherwise be legal to play in that tournament’s format. These cards should be interpreted using their current Oracle™ wordings.

103.	Card Interpretation
Cards are interpreted using the Oracle card reference. During sanctioned tournaments, players must refer to this version of a card to settle disputes concerning the interpretation of a card’s wording or abilities. Card abilities are based on card text, not artwork.

Players may not use errors or omissions in Oracle to disrupt a tournament or otherwise abuse the rules. The head judge is the final authority for card interpretations, and he or she may overrule Oracle if an error is discovered.

Certain cards refer to “a card (or cards) you own from outside the game.” In DCI-sanctioned play, "a card you own from outside the game" is one of the following things: (a) A card you own that's in the removed-from-the-game zone. It can be in that zone for any reason. (b) A card that's in your sideboard. 

104.	New Releases
The following card sets are scheduled for release during 2008. They become tournament legal for DCI-sanctioned tournaments on the dates listed:

•	Shadowmoor™	Limited and constructed formats: May 2, 2008
	

•	Eventide™	Limited and constructed formats: July 25, 2008
	

For certain Limited tournaments, such as official Prereleases and Sneak Preview tournaments (including their side events), new sets are legal for use before the official Limited format legal date.

These dates are subject to change. Any changes will be announced at thedci.com.

105.	Participation Minimums
The DCI requires participation minimums for a tournament to be sanctioned and included as part of a player’s official ratings and rankings. For Magic: The Gathering tournaments, the participation minimums are as follows:
•	For individual events, a minimum of eight (8) players must participate.
•	For team and multiplayer events, a minimum of four (4) teams must participate.

If the participation minimum is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned, and will not be included in DCI ratings. If participation minimums are not met for any DCI-sanctioned event, the tournament organizer should report the event to the DCI as “Did Not Occur.”

106.	Minimum Number of Rounds
The DCI requires a minimum number of rounds for a tournament to be sanctioned and included as part of a player’s official ratings and rankings. For Magic: The Gathering tournaments, the minimum number of rounds required is as follows:
•	For individual events, a minimum of three (3) rounds.
•	For team and multiplayer events, a minimum of two (2) rounds.

If the minimum number of rounds is not met, the tournament is no longer DCI-sanctioned, and will not be included in DCI ratings. If minimum number of rounds is not met for any DCI-sanctioned event, the tournament organizer should report the event to the DCI as “Did Not Occur.”

110. 	MAGIC: THE GATHERING TOURNAMENT MECHANICS

111.	Match Structure
Three is the default number of games in a Magic match, and tournament organizers must allow three games per match. If a tournament organizer chooses, he or she may run single-elimination final rounds as best three games out of five. This choice must be announced before the tournament begins. Match results, not individual game results, are reported to the DCI for the purpose of inclusion in worldwide ratings and rankings.

Drawn games (games without a winner) do not count towards one of the games in a match. The match should continue until one player has won the majority of games as long as match time allows.

112.	Match Time Limits
The required minimum time limit for any match is 40 minutes.

The following time limits are recommended for each round of a tournament:
•	Constructed and Limited tournaments—50 minutes
•	Single-elimination quarterfinal or semifinal matches—90 minutes
•	Single-elimination final matches—no time limit

The following time limits are recommended for Limited tournaments:
•	Sealed Deck—20 minutes for deck registration and 30 minutes for deck construction
•	Draft—30 minutes for deck registration and construction
•	Team Sealed Deck—20 minutes for deck registration and 60 minutes for deck construction
•	Team Draft—30 minutes for deck construction and registration
•	Multiplayer Draft—40 minutes for deck construction and registration

Magic Premier Events may have different time limits. These time limits can be found in the event or event series Fact Sheet. Fact Sheets are located in the MagicTheGathering.com Tournament Center: www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/tournamentcenter.
 
113.	Play/Draw Rule
For the first game of a match, the winner of a coin toss (or other random method) chooses either to play first and skip his or her first draw step or to play second. The winner of the coin toss must state this choice before looking at his or her hand. If the coin toss winner states no choice, it is assumed that he or she is playing first. The player who plays first skips the draw step of his or her first turn. Each turn thereafter follows the standard order set forth in the Magic Comprehensive Rules (see section 101.5a). This is commonly referred to as the play/draw rule.

After each game in a match, the loser of that game (even if the game loss was due to a penalty) decides whether to play first in the next game. If the game was a draw (there was no winner or loser), the player who decided to play or draw for that game chooses for the next game.

114.	Pregame Procedure
Before a game begins, players determine who plays first (see section 113). This may be done any time during the pregame procedure before the players look at their hands. (Note that players are not required to decide who plays first before sideboarding.) The following steps must be performed before each game begins:
1.	Players may exchange cards in their decks for cards in their sideboards (only after the first game of the match).
2.	Players shuffle their decks (see Universal Tournament Rules, section 21). Note that players may stop shuffling to perform additional sideboarding but must then shuffle sufficiently.
3.	Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling and cutting.
4.	If the opponent has shuffled the player’s deck, that player may make one final cut.
5. 	Players present their sideboards and put them in a clearly distinguishable place. 
6.	Each player draws seven cards. Optionally, these cards may be dealt face down on the table.
7.	Each player, in turn order, decides whether to mulligan (see section 115).

Once mulligans are resolved, the game can begin.

Prior to the first game in a match, steps 1–7 above may be performed by the players before the official time for that match begins.

115.	Mulligan Rule
Before each game begins, a player may, for any reason, reshuffle and redraw his or her hand, drawing one less card. This may be repeated as often as the player wishes, until he or she has no cards left in his or her hand.

The decision of whether to mulligan passes between players following the order established in section 113. After the participant who plays first mulligans as often as he or she likes, the decision of whether to mulligan passes to the other player. Once a player passes the opportunity to mulligan, that player may not change his or her mind.

116.	End-of-Match Procedure
If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the active player (as defined in the Magic game rules) finishes his or her turn and five total additional turns are played. For example, time is called on player A’s turn. Player A finishes his or her turn. Player B takes extra turn #1, Player A takes extra turn #2, Player B takes extra turn #3, player A takes extra turn #4, and player B takes extra turn #5.

Players take any extra turns granted to them by effects as they normally would during the course of the game, but any extra turn counts as one of the five end-of-match turns. Once five extra turns are completed, the game finishes regardless of any remaining effect-generated extra turns.

If the game finishes before the fifth turn is completed, the match is over and no new game begins.

If a judge assigned a time or turn extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason), the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time or turn extension.

A game that is not completed when the match ends is considered a draw. Any games that have not been played when the match ends are not counted in the final match score.

117.	Determining a Match Winner
In Swiss rounds, the player with the most game wins is the winner of the match. If both players have equal game wins, the match is a draw.

In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw. After the end-of-match procedure is finished, the player with more game wins is the winner of the match. If both players have equal game wins when the end-of-match procedure is finished, the player with the lower life total becomes the loser of the current game. In the event the players have equal life totals (or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match should continue until the first life total change that results in one player having a lower life total than the other.

118.	Tie Breaks
The following tie breaks are used in Magic tournaments to determine how a player ranks in standings for a particular tournament:

1.	Match points
2.	Opponents’ match-win percentage
3.	Game-win percentage
4.	Opponents’ game-win percentages

The definitions of these tie breaks and how they work in tournaments can be found in the DCI Tournament Coordinator Handbook.

120.	RULES FOR CONSTRUCTED TOURNAMENTS

121.	Deck Size Limits
Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, players must be able to sufficiently randomize their deck within the time allotted.

With the exception of basic land cards, a player’s combined deck and sideboard may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title. All cards named Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest are basic. (The five basic snow lands, also known as “Snow-Covered lands”—Snow-Covered Plains, Snow-Covered Island, Snow-Covered Swamp, Snow-Covered Mountain, and Snow-Covered Forest—are also basic lands. Note that basic snow lands, also known as “Snow-Covered lands” lands are permitted only in formats that allow the Ice Age™, Alliances™, and/or Coldsnap™ sets.)

122.	Sideboard Use 
If a player wishes to use a sideboard, it must contain exactly fifteen cards.

Before each game begins, players must present their sideboards and allow their opponents to count the number of cards in their sideboards (face down), if requested. Players may look at their sideboards during a game only if the sideboard remains distinguishable from other cards. If a player is resolving a spell or effect that refers to “choosing a card from outside the game,” the player may look at his or her sideboard. (See section 103). The sideboard must be clearly identified and separated from all other cards in the play area. The sideboard may not be kept where it could be confused or switched with other cards.

The deck and sideboard must each be returned to their original compositions before the first game of each match. Cards transferred from a player’s deck to his or her sideboard, and vice versa, must be returned before the player begins a new match. If a penalty causes a player to forfeit the first game in a match before that game began, neither player may use cards from his or her sideboard for the second game.

Before the beginning of the second or subsequent game in a match, players may change the composition of their decks by exchanging cards from their decks for cards in their sideboards. Any card exchange between decks and sideboards must be made on a one-for-one basis to ensure that the sideboards remain at exactly fifteen cards. There are no restrictions on the number of cards a player may exchange this way. Players are not required to reveal how many cards he or she is sideboarding.

130.	RULES FOR LIMITED TOURNAMENTS

131.	Deck-Size Limits
Main decks must contain a minimum of forty cards. There is no maximum deck size. All cards a player received but is not using in his or her main deck become that player’s sideboard.

Players are not restricted to four of any one card in Limited tournament play.

132.	Sideboard Use
Any drafted or opened cards not used in a player’s Limited deck function as his or her sideboard. Players may look at their sideboards during a game only if the sideboard remains distinguishable from other cards. If a player is resolving a spell or effect that refers to “choosing a card from outside the game,” the player may look at his or her sideboard. (See section 103). The sideboard must be clearly identified and separated from all other cards in the play area. The sideboard may not be kept where it could be confused or switched with other cards.

Before the beginning of the second or subsequent game in a match, players may change the composition of their decks by exchanging cards from their decks for cards in their sideboards. Players can also request additional basic land at this time. There are no restrictions on the number of cards a player may exchange this way as long as the main deck contains at least forty cards. Cards do not need to be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. The deck must be returned to its original composition before the first game of each match.

(Exception: Players participating in Prerelease or Release events may be allowed to freely change the composition of their decks between games by exchanging cards from their decks for cards in their sideboards without being required to return their deck to its original composition before their next match. The tournament organizer or judge will announce if this option is available. This option in not available at any other type of event except Prerelease and Release events.)


133.	Materials Provided
Tournament organizers and/or the head judge may choose to provide basic lands for players to use during the tournament. If the organizer provides basic lands, the same amount of land must be available to each player. Organizers must announce before and during event registration whether they will provide players with access to basic lands. Organizers may require players to return basic land cards when they leave the tournament.

(Note: If the tournament organizer is not able to provide players basic land cards for use in their Limited tournaments, players may use their own basic lands cards during the tournament as long as those lands are in good condition and are not marked.)


134.	Rules for Sealed Deck Tournaments
In Sealed Deck tournaments, players may add as many basic lands as desired to their decks during deck construction, however, players may not add additional Basic snow lands, also known as “Snow-Covered lands”, in Limited formats that use the Ice Age, Alliances, and/or Coldsnap sets. Extra lands are allowed for sideboards, and players may add basic lands to their sideboards any time between games.

135.	Rules for Draft Tournaments
In Draft tournaments, players may add as many basic lands to their decks as desired; no maximum is imposed, however, players may not add additional Basic snow lands, also known as “Snow-Covered lands”, in Limited formats that use the Ice Age, Alliances, and/or Coldsnap sets. Extra lands are allowed for sideboards, and players may add basic lands to their sideboards any time between games.


140.	RULES FOR TEAM TOURNAMENTS
	 
141.	General Team Requirements
Each individual team must have unique, team-specific information, including: 
•	a team name,
•	team members (with their respective DCI membership numbers).

142.	Team Names
Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to disallow any team name it deems offensive and/or obscene. Tournament organizers and certified head judges should discourage teams from registering team names that may be considered offensive and/or obscene. 

143.	Team Composition and Identification
A valid team consists of two or three members, as appropriate to the DCI-sanctioned team format (see section 101). A team is identified by the individual DCI membership numbers of its respective members. Individual DCI members may be members of more than one team.

144.	Valid Team Participation and Player Designation
Sanctioned team tournaments are open to teams consisting of two or three members. Only valid teams of the appropriate size are eligible for a DCI-sanctioned team tournament. If a player drops or is disqualified from the event, the entire team is dropped from the event.

Each team entering a DCI-sanctioned tournament must provide the tournament organizer with its team-specific information (see section 141) when registering for the event. Failure to provide this information will result in the team’s disqualification from the tournament.

Example: A sanctioned three-person team tournament is open only to teams consisting of three members; teams consisting of two members cannot compete in this event.

Teams must designate player positions during event registration. For example, in a three-player team event, each team must designate who is player A, player B, and player C. Players retain these designations throughout the entire tournament.

When two teams are paired against each other during the course of a tournament, the team members designated as player A play against each other, the team members designated as player B play against each other, and so on.

145.	Team Constructed Tournaments
Event results for all DCI-sanctioned team Constructed tournaments (Vintage, Legacy, Extended, and Standard) are merged into one set of Constructed ratings for each team size.

Team tournaments using any DCI-sanctioned Constructed format must adhere to all applicable sections of the Magic DCI Floor Rules and DCI Universal Tournament Rules for Constructed tournaments.

Team Constructed tournaments use Unified Deck Construction rules: With the exception of basic land cards, a team’s combined decks and sideboards may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title. (For example, if one player has four main-deck copies of Naturalize in a Team Constructed event, no other player on that team may have a Naturalize in his or her deck or sideboard.) If a card is restricted in a particular format, no more than one of that card may be used by the team. No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format.

146.	Team Limited Tournaments
Event results for each DCI-sanctioned team Limited tournament (Sealed Deck and Rochester Draft) are merged into one set of Limited ratings for each team size. 

Team tournaments using any DCI-sanctioned Limited format must adhere to all applicable sections of the Magic DCI Floor Rules and DCI Universal Tournament Rules for Limited tournaments.

147.	Team Rochester Draft Tournaments
Team Rochester Draft events require teams of three players each and two teams are seated at each table for the draft. Team members sit clockwise in A-B-C order around the table. (For example, in a three-person team event, players sit around the table clockwise in this order: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C.)

During the draft, talking is allowed. However, the taking of (or communicating via) written notes is not permitted.

A team determined at random chooses either to pick first or to allow the other team to pick first. The “B” player of the team that picks first lays out the first pack. All fifteen cards are drafted from the pack following the standard Rochester Draft rules for timing and active-player rotation (see the Universal Tournament Rules, sections 76 and 77).

Example: Team 1 and Team 2 are seated around a table. They are numbered 1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C in a clockwise order. Team 2 wins the coin toss, and the members of Team 2 choose to let Team 1 pick first. The active player for the first pack is Player 1B. The first booster pack for Player 1B is opened and placed face up in front of Player 1B. After the 30-second review period has expired, the draft order is as follows:

Player 1B—card 1		Player 1A—card 6		Player 1C—card 11
Player 1C—card 2		Player 1A—card 7		Player 1B—card 12
Player 2A—card 3		Player 2C—card 8		Player 1B—card 13
Player 2B—card 4		Player 2B—card 9		Player 1C—card 14
Player 2C—card 5		Player 2A—card 10		Player 2A—card 15
 
148.	Team Sealed Deck Tournaments
Teams are issued sealed product based on which expansions have been released in the current block. Every team must receive the same product mix. For example, if one team receives two Time Spiral tournament packs and four Time Spiral boosters, every team must receive two Time Spiral tournament pack and four Time Spiral boosters.

All cards must be assigned to a player’s deck or sideboard during deck construction and cannot be transferred to another player during that tournament. (Players do not share main deck or sideboard cards.) All decks must contain a minimum of forty cards. Any number of the remaining cards may be assigned as a sideboard to any player. Players may add as many basic lands as they need to their main deck at the start of the tournament or to their sideboard between games.

Three-Person Team Events
The DCI recommends that each team receive two tournament packs and four boosters. The tournament packs will always be from the large expansion. If no small expansions have yet been released, the boosters will also be from the large expansion. If the first small expansion has been released, the four boosters should be from the first small expansion. If the second small expansion has been released, two boosters should be from the first small expansion and two boosters from the second small expansion.

Two-Person Team Events
The DCI recommends that each team receive one tournament pack and four boosters. The tournament pack will always be from the large expansion. If no small expansions have been released, the boosters will also be from the large expansion. If the first small expansion has been released, one booster should be from the large expansion and three boosters from the first small expansion. If the second small expansion has been released, two boosters the first small expansion, and two boosters from the second small expansion are used.


150.	RULES FOR MULTIPLAYER TOURNAMENTS
On October 1, 2005, the DCI began sanctioning multiplayer tournaments (see section 101) for the Two-Headed Giant variant. Game rules for the Two-Headed Giant found can be found in section 6 of the Magic Comprehensive Rules.

The deck construction rules listed in sections 125–129, and the general rules for team tournaments listed in sections 141–144 of this document also apply to multiplayer tournaments. However, multiplayer tournaments differ from other tournaments as explained in the rest of this section.

152.	Match Structure
	Multiplayer matches consist of one game.

Drawn games (games without a winner) do not count towards the one game. As long as match time allows, the match should continue until a team has won a game.

153.	Play-Draw Rule
A team determined at random chooses either to play first, or to play second. The choice must be made before either player on that team looks at his or her hand. If either player on the team looks at his or her hand before a choice is made, that team plays first. The team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.

    

154.	Pregame Procedure
1. Players should be seated with the primary player (Player A) to the right of his or her teammate.
2. Players shuffle their decks (see Universal Tournament Rules, section 21).
3. Players present their decks to their opponents for additional shuffling and cutting.
4. If an opponent has shuffled a player’s deck, that player may make one final cut.
5. Each player draws seven cards.
6. Each player, in turn order, decides whether to mulligan (see section 155).

Once mulligans are resolved, the game can begin.

155.	Multiplayer Mulligan Rule
As part of the pregame procedure, a player may, for any reason, reshuffle and redraw a hand of seven cards. This is referred to as the “free mulligan.” That player may then reshuffle and redraw his or her hand, drawing one less card. That player may repeat the process of shuffling and drawing one less card as often as he or she wishes, until he or she has no cards left in their hand.

The team that will play first resolves its mulligans first. (Teammates may communicate with each other at all times during the match, including during mulligans.) The mulligan process then proceeds according to the Magic Comprehensive Rules (see section 606.6a).

156.	End-of-Match Procedure
If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the active team finishes its turn and three total additional turns are played. For example, time is called on Team Y’s turn. Team Y finishes its turn. Team Z takes extra turn #1. Team Y takes extra turn #2, and Team Z takes extra turn #3.

Teams take any extra turns granted to them by effects as they normally would during the course of the game, but any extra turn counts as one of the three end-of-match turns. Once the third turn is completed, the game finishes regardless of any remaining effect-generated extra turns.

If a judge assigned a time extension to the match, the end-of-match procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension.

157.	Determining a Match Winner
In Swiss rounds, the team that wins the game wins the match. If neither team has won the game after completing the end-of-match procedures, the match is a draw.

Rules for Single Elimination Rounds
In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw. If neither team has won the game after completing the end-of-match procedure, the team with the lowest life total is the loser of the game and the match. If both teams have equal life totals, the game continues until the first life total change that results in one team having a higher life total than the other. Should a game end in a draw during the end-of-match procedure, players start a new game and play until the first life total change that results in one team having a higher life total than the other.


160.	RULES FOR MULTIPLAYER CONSTRUCTED TOURNAMENTS

161.	Deck Size Limits
Constructed decks must contain a minimum of sixty cards. There is no maximum deck size; however, players must be able to sufficiently randomize their deck within the time allotted.

Multiplayer Constructed tournaments use Unified Deck Construction rules: With the exception of basic land cards, a team’s combined decks may not contain more than four of any individual card, counted by its English card title. (For example, if one player is using four copies of Naturalize in a Multiplayer Constructed event, no other player on that team may have a Naturalize in his or her deck.) If a card is restricted in a particular format, no more than one of that card may be used by the team. No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format.

In addition to cards banned in particular formats, the following card is banned in ALL Multiplayer Constructed tournaments (Vintage, Legacy, Extended, and Block):
•	Erayo, Soratami Ascendant

162.	Sideboard Use
Sideboards are not allowed in Constructed Multiplayer tournaments.


170.	RULES FOR MULTIPLAYER LIMITED TOURNAMENTS
Multiplayer Limited tournaments must adhere to all applicable sections of the Magic DCI Floor Rules and DCI Universal Tournament Rules for Limited tournaments.

The DCI recommends that each team receive one tournament pack and four boosters or seven boosters. Every team must receive the same product mix. For example, if one team receives a Time Spiral tournament pack and four Time Spiral boosters, every team must receive a Time Spiral tournament pack and four Time Spiral boosters.

171.	Deck-Size Limits
Each player’s deck must contain a minimum of forty cards. There is no maximum deck size. Neither teams nor individuals are restricted to four of any one card in Limited tournaments. Cards not used in a team’s starting decks are considered a shared sideboard by the two players that both players can access.

172.	Sideboard Use
For the purpose of cards that allow you to choose cards from “outside the game,” all cards not assigned to the players’ main decks are considered a shared sideboard by the two players that both players can access. Players may look at their sideboards during a game only if the sideboard remains distinguishable from other cards. If a player is resolving a spell or effect that refers to “choosing a card from outside the game,” the player may look at his or her sideboard. (See section 103). The sideboard must be clearly identified and separated from all other cards in the play area. The sideboard may not be kept where it could be confused or switched with other cards.

173.	Multiplayer Booster Draft Tournaments
Multiplayer Booster Draft follows the procedures for Multiplayer Limited tournaments (see sections 140–146, 150–157, and 170–172). The draft proceeds like a normal Booster Draft (as outlined in the DCI Universal Tournament Rules, sections 70–74), with the following exceptions.

Teams (not players) assemble randomly into draft pods of roughly equal size. Teammates sit next to each other. A tournament official then distributes two identical sets of new booster packs to each team in the pod.

The players on a team may consult freely during the draft, provided that they adhere to the time limits for card selection. Taking, giving, or receiving notes during drafting and deck construction is still disallowed.

The order in which packs are opened is the same as in Booster Draft, but each player’s pack is opened separately. For example, in a Time Spiral–Planar Chaos–Future Sight draft, the order in which the packs are opened would be Time Spiral–Time Spiral–Planar Chaos–Planar Chaos–Future Sight–Future Sight.

After opening and counting the cards in their first pack, the team chooses two cards from the booster pack then passes the remaining cards face down to the team on its left. The cards chosen are not assigned to a particular player; they become part of a pool out of which both players will build their decks. The open packs are passed around the drafting pod—with each team taking two cards from each before passing—until all cards are drafted. Each team’s last pick for each booster will consist of only one card.

For the second pack, the direction of drafting is reversed as usual, despite the fact that it is always the same type of booster pack as the first. Thus, the overall draft direction is left–right–left–right–left–right.

The time allotted for each pick is altered as follows:

Cards remaining in pack	Time allotted
15	50 seconds
13	45 seconds
11	40 seconds
9	30 seconds
7	20 seconds
5	10 seconds
3	10 seconds
1	N/A

In addition, players receive 60 seconds to review their drafted cards in between booster packs.

Each team has 40 minutes to construct one deck for each player from its common pool of cards. All drafted cards not played in a main deck should be recorded as a common, shared sideboard.
