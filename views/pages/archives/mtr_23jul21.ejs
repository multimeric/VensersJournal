      <div id="section11" class='collapse'>
        <p>Sanctioned, rated tournaments are divided into two types: Premier and non-Premier. Premier tournaments are run 
                  by Wizards of the Coast or select Tournament Organizers. They have unique names and features. Non-Premier 
                  tournaments are tournaments that are not explicitly Premier.</p>

        <p>There are two major tournament formats: Limited and Constructed. Each has rules specific to its format. In 
                  Limited tournaments, all product for play is provided during the tournament. In Constructed tournaments, players 
                  compete using decks prepared beforehand. Some Premier tournaments may consist of multiple formats within the 
                  same tournament.</p>

      <div id="section12" class='collapse'>
        <p>Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to publish DCI-sanctioned tournament information at any time (including 
                  during the tournament). Tournament information includes, but is not limited to, the contents of one or more 
                  players' decks, descriptions of strategies or play, transcripts, and video reproductions. Tournament Organizers are 
                  also allowed to publish this information once their tournament is complete.</p>

      <div id="section13" class='collapse'>
        <p>The following roles are defined for tournament purposes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Tournament Organizer</li>
          <li>Head Judge </li>
          <li>Floor Judge</li>

          <li>Spectator</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>The first four roles above are considered tournament officials. The Head Judge and floor judges are collectively 
                  considered judges. A single individual may act in any combination of tournament official roles. Individuals who 
                  are not judges at a tournament are spectators in any match in which they are not playing. Members of the press are 
                  also considered Spectators.</p>

      <div id="section14" class='collapse'>
        <p>Anyone is eligible to participate as a player in a DCI-sanctioned tournament except for:</p> 

        <ul>
          <li>Individuals currently suspended by the DCI.
                Individuals currently suspended from the DCI may not act as tournament officials;</li> 
          <li>Other individuals specifically prohibited from participation by DCI or Wizards of the Coast policy 
                  (such determination is at Wizards of the Coast’s sole discretion); </li>
          <li>Individuals thirteen (13) years of age and younger who do not have their parent/guardians’ 
                  permission; </li>

                  venue’s management.</li>
          <li>Tournament Organizers may choose to age restrict any Regular REL events that they organize. They 
                  must clearly indicate this in their marketing for the event on the Store and Event Locator description 
                  as well as any other place they display the event information. (i.e. Tournament Organizers may 
                  advertise an age 16 and under Friday Night Magic).</li>

        <p>Anyone is eligible to participate as a tournament official (Tournament Organizer, Head Judge, floor judge or 
               Scorekeeper) for a tournament except for:</p> 

        <ul>
          <li>Individuals currently suspended by the DCI;</li>
          <li>Anyone who has played in the tournament, unless it is a tournament that explicitly allows tournament officials 
                    to play while acting as a tournament official.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tournament officials may play in a DCI-sanctioned, rated tournament for which they are a tournament official if 
               (and only if) the tournament is of the following types:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Friday Night Magic</li>
          <li>Prerelease</li>
          <li>Magic Weekend</li>

                officials of that tournament to play</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If one or more tournament officials play in the tournament, it must be run at Regular Rules Enforcement Level. If 
              tournament officials play in the tournament and the tournament is not one of the allowed types listed above, the 
              tournament will be invalidated. Tournament officials are required to officiate tournaments fairly and without 
              regard to their own self-interest.</p>

        <p>The owners of organizations that run Premier Events are not permitted to play in those tournaments, even if the 
              owner is not listed as a tournament official (organizer, judge, and/or scorekeeper) for that tournament.</p>

        <p>Premier Events include the following tournaments: Magic: The Gathering World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, WPN Qualifiers, WPN Preliminary Events, Players Tour Qualifiers, Magic Premier Series, Grand Prix, Grand Prix Trials.</p>

        <p>Some tournaments have additional criteria regarding player and tournament official eligibility (e.g. invitation-only 
              tournaments, such as Players Tour and Players Tour Finals).</p>

        <p>The Players Tour Invitation Policy defines specific eligibility rules with regards to certain types of invitation-
              only Premier Tournaments (e.g. Players Tour and Players Tour Finals).</p>

      <div id="section17" class='collapse'>
        <p>Sanctioned tournaments require the physical presence of a Head Judge during play to adjudicate disputes, 
              interpret rules, and make other official decisions. The Head Judge is the final judicial authority at any DCI-
              sanctioned tournament and all tournament participants are expected to follow their interpretations. Although it is 
              beneficial, the Head Judge does not have to be certified.</p>

        <p>The Head Judge’s responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to deal with game or policy rule violations that they notice 
                or are brought to their attention.</li>
          <li>Issuing the final ruling in all appeals, potentially overturning the ruling of a floor judge.</li> 
          <li>Coordinating and delegating tasks to floor judges as needed.</li>
          <li>If necessary, the Head Judge may temporarily transfer their duties to any judge if they are unable to fulfill them 
                for a period of time. Also, in exceptional circumstances, if the tournament’s integrity would be damaged 
                otherwise, the Tournament Organizer may replace the Head Judge.</li>
          <li>Certain Premier tournaments have multiple Head Judges and/or different Head Judges for different portions of the 
                tournament. All Head Judges share the same responsibilities and exercise the same authority while they are 
                serving as a Head Judge.</li>

        <p>Floor judges are available to players and spectators to answer questions, deal with illegal plays, or assist with 
             reasonable requests. They do not have to be certified.</p>

        <p>Judges will not generally assist players in determining the current game state but can answer questions about the 
              rules, interactions between cards, or provide the Oracle™ wordings of relevant cards. At Regular Rules 
              Enforcement Level, the judge may assist the player in understanding the game state in the interest of education. If 
              a player wishes to ask their question away from the table, the request will usually be honored. Players may not 
              request specific judges to answer their calls but may request a tournament official to help translate. This request 
              may be honored at the discretion of the original judge.</p>

        <p>Judges do not intervene in a game to prevent illegal actions but do intervene as soon as a rule has been broken or

        <p>Players retain their responsibilities even if a judge provides them with extra assistance.</p>

        <p>The individual members of a team are considered players, and are equally responsible for required tournament

      <div id="section112" class='collapse'>
        <p>Rules Enforcement Levels (REL) are a means to communicate to the players and judges what expectations they 
              can have of the tournament in terms of rigidity of rules enforcement, technically correct play, and procedures 
              used.</p>

        <p>The Rules Enforcement Level of a tournament generally reflects the prizes awarded and the distance a player may 
              be expected to travel.</p>

        <h5>Regular</h5> 

        <p>Regular tournaments are focused on fun and social aspects, not enforcement. Most tournaments are run at this 
               level unless they offer sizeable prizes or invitations. Players are expected to know most of the game rules, may 
               have heard of policy and what is “really bad,” but generally play in a fashion similar to the way they do casually. 
               Players are still responsible for following the rules, but the focus is on education and sportsmanship over 
               technically precise play. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Judging at Regular Rules 
               Enforcement Level document, located at <a href='http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-judging-regular-rel'>http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-judging-regular-rel</a>.</p> 

        <h5>Competitive</h5>

        <p>Competitive tournaments are usually those with significant cash prizes or invitations awarded to Professional 
               tournaments. Players are expected to know the game’s rules and be familiar with the policies and procedures, but 
               unintentional errors are not punished severely. These are tournaments that protect the interests of all players by 
               providing tournament integrity while also recognizing that not all players are intimately familiar with 
               Professional-level tournament structure, proper procedures, and rules. Infractions in these tournaments are 
               covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, located at <a href='http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide'>http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>.</p> 

        <h5>Professional</h5> 

        <p>Professional level tournaments offer large cash awards, prestige, and other benefits that draw players from great 
              distances. These tournaments hold players to a higher standard of behavior and technically-correct play than 
              Competitive tournaments. Infractions in these tournaments are covered by the Magic Infraction Procedure Guide, 
              located at <a href='http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide'>http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide</a>. </p>

      <div id="section21" class='collapse'>
        <p>A Magic match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games, 
               usually two. Drawn games do not count toward this goal. If the round ends before a player has won the required 
               number of games, the winner of the match is the player who has won the most games at that point. If both players 
               have equal game wins, the match is a draw.</p>

        <p>The Tournament Organizer may change the required number of games to be won for any portion of the 
              tournament as long as this choice is announced before the tournament begins. Match results, not individual game 
              results, are reported to the DCI.</p>

        <p>For the first game of a match, a designated player - the winner of a random method (such as a die roll or coin toss) 
              during Swiss rounds, or the player ranked higher at the end of Swiss rounds during playoff matches - chooses 
              either to play first or to play second. They must state this choice before looking at their hand. If they state no 
              choice, it is assumed that they are playing first. The player who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. 
              This is referred to as the play/draw rule.</p>

        <p>After each game in a match, the loser of that game decides whether to play first in the next game. They may wait 
              until after sideboarding to make the decision. If the previous game was a draw, the player who decided to play or 
              draw at the beginning of the drawn game chooses.</p>

      <div id="section24" class='collapse'>
        <p>If a game or match is not completed, players may concede or mutually agree to a draw in that game or match. A 
              match is considered complete once the result slip is filled out or, if match slips are not being used, a player leaves 
              the table after game play is finished. Until that point, either player may concede to or draw with the other, though 
              if the conceding player won a game in the match, the match must be reported as 2-1. Intentional draws where no 
              games were played are always reported as 0-0-3 <span class="removed">or by using the “draw” button (0-0) in Wizards Event Reporter 
              (WER)</span> <span class="new">in Eventlink</span>.</p>

        <p>Players may not agree to a concession or draw in exchange for any reward or incentive. Doing so will be 
              considered Bribery (see section 5.2).</p>

        <p>If a player refuses to play, it is assumed that they have conceded the match.</p>

      <div id="section25" class='collapse'>
        <p>If the match time limit is reached before a winner is determined, the player whose turn it is finishes their turn and 
               five additional turns are played in total. This usually means that one player takes three turns and the other two, but 
               a player taking extra turns may affect this. If the active player has already indicated that they<span class="removed">'d</span> <span class="new">would</span> like to pass the turn when the time limit is reached, that is considered to be in the next turn.</p>

        <p>Team tournaments featuring multiple players playing together (such as Two-Headed Giant) use three turns instead of five.</p>

        <p>Once time is called, no new games should begin.</p>

        <p>If the game is incomplete at the end of additional turns, the game is considered a draw.</p>

        <p>If a judge assigned a time extension (because of a long ruling, deck check, or other reason) the end-of-match 
              procedure does not begin until the end of the time extension.</p>

        <p>In single-elimination rounds, matches may not end in a draw. If all players have equal game wins at the end of 
              additional turns, the player with the highest life total wins the current game. In the event all players have equal 
              life totals (or are between games and the game wins are tied), the game/match continues with an additional state-
              based action: if a player does not have the highest life total, they lose the game. Two-Headed Giant teams are 
              treated as a single player for determining a game winner.</p>

      <h3 class='panel-title' data-toggle='collapse' data-target="#section26">2.6 Time Extensions</h3>

      <div id="section26" class='collapse'>
        <p>If a judge pauses a match for more than one minute while the round clock is running, they should extend the 
              match time appropriately. If the match was interrupted to perform a deck check, players are awarded time equal to 
              the time the deck check took plus three minutes. </p>

        <p>Feature matches at a tournament with online coverage receive a time extension equal to three minutes plus time 
              elapsed in the round when players reach their table. This is not necessary if feature matches are being timed 
              separately.</p>

        <p>Certain slow play penalties add turns rather than a time extension. These additional turns are added to the end-of-
              match additional turns.</p>

              Enforcement Level tournaments. The Head Judge may require registration in Regular Rules Enforcement Level 
              tournaments.</p>

        <p>Registered decklists record the original composition of each deck and sideboard (if applicable). Once your 
              decklist has been accepted by a Tournament Official it may not be altered.</p>

        <p>In Constructed tournaments, decklists must be submitted to a tournament official prior to the start of round 1, 
              even if the player has an awarded bye for that round.</p>

        <p>In Limited tournaments, decklists must be submitted prior to the start of the first round in which that player 
              participates and does not have an awarded bye.</p>

        <p>Players have the right to request to see their decklist between matches. Such a request will be honored if 
              logistically possible. </p>

        <p>Generally, decklists are not public information and are not shared with other players during a tournament. At 
              Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments (World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, and Grand Prix), copies of opponents’ decklists will be provided to players in the

      <div id="section210" class='collapse'>
        <p>Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If a player drops from a tournament before the first round of 
              play has started, they are considered to have not participated in the tournament and will not be listed in the finish 
              order. Players choosing to drop from a tournament must inform the 
              Scorekeeper by the means provided for that tournament before the pairings for the next round are generated. 
              Players wanting to drop after the Scorekeeper begins pairing for the next round will be paired for that round. If a 
              player does not show up for their match, they will be automatically dropped from the tournament unless they 
              report to the Scorekeeper. Players that repeatedly and/or intentionally drop from tournaments without informing 
              the scorekeepers of those tournaments may be the subject of penalties up to and including suspension.</p>

        <p>Players who drop during limited tournaments own the cards that they correctly have in their possession at that 
              time. This includes any unopened or partially drafted boosters.</p>

        <p>If a player drops from a tournament after a cut has been made, such as a cut to the top 8 playoff in a Grand Prix 
              tournament, no other player is advanced as a replacement. The highest ranked remaining player receives a bye for 
              the round instead.</p>

        <p>Players who have dropped may reenter a tournament at the discretion of the Head Judge. Players may not reenter 
              a portion of the tournament that requires a deck built during a construction period that the player missed. Players may not reenter a 
              tournament after any cut has been made.</p>

        <p>Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive. 
              Doing so is considered Bribery (see section 5.2).</p>

              the match. Players do not have to explain or reveal notes to other players. Judges may ask to see a player’s notes

        <p>Players may not refer to other notes, including notes from previous matches, during games.</p>

        <p>Between games, players may refer to a brief set of notes made before the match. They are not required to reveal 
              these notes to their opponents. These notes must be removed from the play area before the beginning of the next 
              game. Excessive quantities of notes (more than a sheet or two) are not allowed and may be penalized as slow 
              play.</p>

        <p>The use of electronic devices to take and refer to notes is permitted at Regular Rules Enforcement Level (see 
              section 2.12).</p>

        <p>Players and spectators (exception: authorized press) may not make notes while drafting. Players may not reference 
              any outside notes during drafting, card pool registration, or deck construction.</p>

        <p>Players may refer to Oracle text at any time. They must do so publicly and in a format which contains no other 
              strategic information. Consulting online sources, such as gatherer.wizards.com, is allowed at Regular Rules 
              Enforcement Level even if they contain a small amount of strategic information. If a player wishes to view Oracle

      <div id="section33" class='collapse'>
        <p>Players may use any Authorized Game Cards from Magic: The Gathering expansions, core sets, special sets, 
              supplements, and promotional printings. Authorized Game Cards are cards that, unaltered, meet the following 
              conditions:</p>
         
        <ul>
          <li>The card is genuine and published by Wizards of the Coast</li>
          <li>The card has a standard Magic back, is a double-faced card, or is a card that is part of a meld pair.</li>
          <li>The card does not have squared corners.</li>
          <li>The card is not a token card.</li>
          <li>The card is not damaged or modified in a way that might make it marked.</li>
          <li>The card is otherwise legal for the tournament as defined by the format.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Head Judge of a tournament may issue a proxy (see section 3.4) for a card that has become worn or damaged 
              during the tournament. Any other cards that are not Authorized Game Cards are prohibited in all sanctioned 
              tournaments.</p>

        <p>Players may use cards from the Alpha printing only if the deck is in opaque sleeves.</p>

        <p>Silver-bordered cards may only be used in casual events and only when the format explicitly permits them.</p>

        <p class="new">Dungeons are a special type of nontraditional card. Players are considered to have copies of Dungeon cards at all times, even if they are not currently in possession of the physical card. Any represetantion of the Dungeon card is acceptable, provided it does not cause disruption to the play area or tournament and does not misrepresent the correct progression of the Dungeon card. Multiple players may simultaneously make use of the same Dungeon as long as the representation of each player's marker is clear.</p>

        <p>Players may use otherwise-legal non-English and/or misprinted cards provided they are not using them to create 
              an advantage by using misleading text or pictures. Official promotional textless spells are allowed in sanctioned 
              Magic tournaments in which they would otherwise be legal.</p>

        <p>Artistic modifications are acceptable in sanctioned tournaments, provided that the modifications do not make the 
              card art unrecognizable, contain substantial strategic advice, or contain offensive images. Artistic modifications 
              also may not cover or change the mana cost or name of the card.</p>

        <p>The Head Judge is the final authority on acceptable cards for a tournament. If a player is required to replace a card 
              in their deck and is unable to find a replacement, the player may replace the card with a card named Plains, Island, 
              Swamp, Mountain, or Forest of their choice. This also applies to cards that are lost and must be replaced to have a

        <p>A proxy card is used during competition to represent an otherwise legal Magic card or substitute card
              that can no longer be included in a deck without the deck being marked. For a proxy to be issued, the card it is replacing 
              must meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The card has been accidentally damaged or excessively worn in the current tournament, including 
                damaged or misprinted Limited product. Proxies are not allowed as substitutes for cards that their owner

        <p>Players may not create their own proxies; they may only be created by the Head Judge who has sole discretion as 
              to whether the creation of a proxy is appropriate. 
              When a judge creates a proxy, it is included in the player’s deck andd must be denoted as a proxy in a clear and 
              conspicuous manner. The original card is kept nearby during the match and replaces the proxy while in a public

        <p>If a player uses a substitute card to represent a double-faced card in their deck, then all copies of that double-faced card in the deck must be represented by substitute cards, and any copies of that double-faced card in a hidden zone are considered to not exist for purposes of determining deck legality.</p>

        <p>Each individual checklist card used must have one (and only one) of the items checked.</p>

        <p>A substitute card is only used while the card it represents is in a hidden zone. The card represented by a helper
              card is not a playable Magic card until the substitute card has been placed in a public zone. Multiple substitute cards 
              cannot be used to represent a single copy of the actual card. For each substitute card used, the player must have a 
              copy of the actual card available, though they are not considered sideboard cards and are not presented to their 
              opponent.</p>

	<p>Some older substitute cards contain a list of a set of cards that they may represent. These are sometimes referred to as "checklist cards" and can be used to represent any card listed on them. Each individual checklist card used must have one (and only one) of the items checked.</p>

        <p>A card is considered named in game when a player has provided a description (which may include the name or

        <p>Small items (e.g. glass beads) may be used as markers and placed on top of a player’s own library or graveyard as 
              a reminder for in-game effects. These markers may not disguise the number of cards remaining in that zone nor 
              completely obscure any card.</p>

      <div id="section39" class='collapse' class="new">
        <p class="new">Some game actions use a die roll to determine their outcome. Any method may be used to simulate this as long as all results have an equal chance of occurring. For example, using a 20-sided die to simulate a 6-sided die by dividing by 3 and rounding up (rerolling on 19 or 20) is acceptable. Dice with similar numbers clumped together (such as a spindown life tracker) may not be used for these actions</p>

        <p class="new">Dice must have clear and easy to read values, and not be so large as to be disruptive when rolled. They must be rolled from a disceranble height. Dice that leave the playing surface after landing, become mixed with similar dice, or do not land flat are ignored and rerolled.</p>

        <p class="new">Players are expected to be clear about why they are rolling a die. A player who wishes to respond to a die roll is expected to the prevent the rolling player from taking action, but the rolling player cannot rush through to preempt responses. A die roll is complete once the result is visible to the opponent.</p>

        <p>Some actions may require multiple dice to be rolled. If additional rolls would have no impact on the game, the player skips them. If a player rolls too many dice at once, all those dice are ignored and the correct number of dice are rolled.</p>

      <h3 class='panel-title' data-toggle='collapse' data-target="#section310"><span class="removed">3.9</span> <span class="new">3.10</span> Card Shuffling</h3>

      <div id="section310" class='collapse'>
        <p>Decks must be randomized at the start of every game and whenever an instruction requires it. Randomization is 
              defined as bringing the deck to a state where no player can have any information regarding the order or position of 
              cards in any portion of the deck. Pile shuffling may not be performed other than once each at the beginning of a game 
              to count the cards in the deck.</p>
         
        <p>Once the deck is randomized, it must be presented to an opponent. By this action, players state that their decks are 
              legal and randomized. The opponent may then shuffle it additionally. Cards and sleeves must not be in danger of 
              being damaged during this process. If the opponent does not believe the player made a reasonable effort to 
              randomize their deck, the opponent must notify a judge. Players may request to have a judge shuffle their cards 
              rather than the opponent; this request will be honored only at a judge’s discretion.</p>

        <p>If a player has had the opportunity to see any of the card faces of the deck being shuffled, the deck is no longer 
              considered randomized and must be randomized again.</p>

        <p>At Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments, players are required to shuffle their 
              opponents’ decks after their owners have shuffled them. The Head Judge can require this at Regular Rules 
              Enforcement Level tournaments as well.</p>

      <div id="section311" class='collapse'>
        <p>Players may use plastic card sleeves or other protective devices on cards. If a player chooses to use card sleeves, 
              all sleeves must be identical and all cards in their deck must be placed in the sleeves in an identical manner. If the 
              sleeves feature holograms or other similar markings, cards must be inserted into the sleeves so these markings 
              appear only on the faces of the cards.</p>

        <p>During a match, a player may request that a judge inspect an opponent’s card sleeves. The judge may disallow the 
              card sleeves if they believe they are marked, worn, or otherwise in a condition or of a design that interferes with 
              shuffling or game play. In the interest of efficiency, the judge may choose to delay any change of sleeves until the 
              end of the match.</p>

        <p>Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level tournaments impose additional restrictions on sleeves. 
              Highly reflective backs are not allowed. Sleeves with hologram patterns across some or all of the sleeve front or 
              back are not allowed. Sleeves with artwork on their backs may be subjected to additional scrutiny, especially if 
              there is no solid border around the edges.</p>

        <p>When using sleeves on double-faced cards, sleeves must be completely opaque.</p>

        <p>The Head Judge is the final authority on what sleeves are allowed.</p>

        <p>Players are responsible for ensuring that their cards and/or card sleeves are not marked during the tournament. A 
              card or sleeve is considered marked if it bears something that makes it possible to identify the card without seeing 
              its face, including (but not limited to) scratches, discoloration, and bends.</p>

        <p>If a player’s cards are sleeved, the cards must be examined while in the sleeves to determine if they are marked. 
              Players should use care when sleeving their decks and should randomize their decks prior to sleeving them to 
              reduce the possibility of cards becoming marked with a pattern. Players should also keep in mind that cards or 
              sleeves may become worn and potentially marked through play during a tournament.</p>

        <p>The Head Judge has the authority to determine if a card in a player’s deck is marked. Judges may request that a 
              player remove their current sleeves or replace any of the deck’s current sleeves immediately, or before the next 
              round.</p>

        <p>Throughout the match, a draft, and pregame procedures, players are responsible for keeping their cards above the

              However, players may choose to reveal their hands or any other hidden information available to them, unless 
              specifically prohibited by the rules. Players must not actively attempt to gain information hidden from them but

      <div id="section316" class='collapse'>
        <p>A sideboard is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. 
              The player may use these cards in their main deck during all games after the first one in a match.</p>

        <p>Before each game begins, players must present their sideboard (if any) face down. Opponents may count the 
              number of cards in their opponent’s sideboard at any time. Players are not required to reveal how many cards they 
              have swapped from their main deck to their sideboard and do not have to swap one for one. Other items (token 
              cards, double-faced card represented in the deck by a substitute card, etc.) should be kept separate from the 
              sideboard during game play.</p>

        <p>During a game, players may look at their own sideboard, keeping it clearly distinguishable from other cards at all 
              times. If a player gains control of another player, they may not look at that player’s sideboard, nor may they have 
              that player access their sideboard.</p>

        <p>The deck and sideboard must each be returned to their original compositions before the first game of each match.</p>

        <p>Restrictions on the composition and use of a sideboard can be found in the deck construction rules for a particular 
              format type.</p>

        <p>If a penalty causes a player to lose the first game in a match before that game has begun, or the first game is 
              intentionally drawn before any cards are played, neither player may use cards from their sideboard for the next 
              game in the match. If players restart a game due to an in-game effect, the composition of their decks must remain 
              the same for the restarted game.</p>

        <p>Certain cards refer to “a (card or cards) from outside the game.” In tournament play, these are cards in that 
              player’s sideboard.</p>

      <div id="section41" class='collapse'>
        <p>Communication between players is essential to the successful play of any game that involves virtual objects or 
              hidden information. While bluffing may be an aspect of games, there need to be clear lines as to what is, and is 
              not, acceptable for players to say or otherwise represent. This will confirm expectations of both sporting and 
              competitive players during a game.</p>

        <p>A player should have an advantage due to better understanding of the options provided by the rules of the game, 
              greater awareness of the interactions in the current game state, and superior tactical planning. Players are under no 
              obligation to assist their opponents in playing the game. Regardless of anything else, players are expected to treat 
              opponents politely and with respect. Failure to do so may lead to Unsporting Conduct penalties.</p>

        <p>There are four categories of information: status, free, derived and private.</p>

        <p>Status information is information that must be announced upon change and physically tracked by the affected 
              player. Methods for tracking must be visible to both players during the match. A shared method is acceptable as 
              long as all players in the match have access to it. At Competitive and Professional REL, methods that can easily 
              be accidentally changed (such as dice) may not be used. Status information consists of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Life totals.</li> 
          <li>Counters a player has attached to them.</<li>
          <li>Continuous effects with no defined expiration within the game that apply to that player, such as Monarch
                  or City’s Blessing.</li>
          <li>Unspent mana in a player's mana pool.</li>
          <li class="new">Location in a dungeon</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Free information is information to which all players are entitled access without contamination or omissions made 
              by their opponents. If a player is ever unable or unwilling to provide free information to an opponent that has 
              requested it, they should call a judge and explain the situation. Free information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Details of current game actions and past game actions that still affect the game state.</li>
          <li>The name of any visible object.</li>
          <li>The number and type of any counter that isn’t defined as status information.</li>
          <li>The state (whether it’s tapped, attached to another permanent, face down, etc.) and current zone of
                  any object or player.</li>
          <li>The game score of the current match.</li>
          <li>The current step and/or phase and which player(s) are active.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Derived information is information to which all players are entitled access, but opponents are not obliged to assist 
              in determining and may require some skill or calculation to determine. Derived information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The number of any kind of objects present in any game zone that are not defined as free information.</li>
          <li>All characteristics of objects in public zones that are not defined as free or status information.</li>
          <li>Game Rules, Tournament Policy, Oracle content and any other official information pertaining to the 
                  current tournament. Cards are considered to have their Oracle text printed on them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Private information is information to which players have access only if they are able to determine it from the 
              current visual game state or their own record of previous game actions.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Any information that is not status, free or derived is automatically private information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following rules govern player communication:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Players must announce any changes to status information about themselves and must represent it with 
                a physical designation.</li>
          <li>If a player notices a discrepancy in recorded or announced status information, they are expected to 
                point it out as soon as the discrepancy is noticed.</li>
          <li>Players must answer all questions asked of them by a judge completely and honestly, regardless of the 
                type of information requested. Players may request to do so away from the match.</li>
          <li>Players may not represent derived, free, or status information incorrectly.</li>
          <li>Players must answer completely and honestly any specific questions pertaining to free information.</li>
          <li>At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, all derived information is instead considered free.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Judges are encouraged to help players in determining free and status information but must avoid assisting players with 
              derived information about the game state.</p>

      <div id="section42" class='collapse'>
        <p>A tournament shortcut is an action taken by players to skip parts of the technical play sequence without explicitly 
              announcing them. Tournament shortcuts are essential for the smooth play of a game, as they allow players to play 
              in a clear fashion without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the rules. Most tournament shortcuts involve 
              skipping one or more priority passes to the mutual understanding of all players; if a player wishes to demonstrate 
              or use a new tournament shortcut entailing any number of priority passes, they must be clear where the game state 
              will end up as part of the request.</p>

        <p>A player may interrupt a tournament shortcut by explaining how they are deviating from it or at which point in the 
              middle they wish to take an action. A player may interrupt their own shortcut in this manner. A player is not 
              allowed to use a previously undeclared tournament shortcut, or to modify an in-use tournament shortcut without 
              announcing the modification, in order to create ambiguity in the game.</p>

        <p>A player may not request priority and take no action with it. If a player decides they do not wish to do anything, 
              the request is nullified and priority is returned to the player that originally had it.</p>

        <p>During the resolution of one of their spells or abilities, a player may not assume their opponent has taken a 
              shortcut. They must seek confirmation that a choice with no visible impact was taken.</p>

        <p>Certain conventional tournament shortcuts used in Magic are detailed below. They define a default 
              communication; if a player wishes to deviate from these, they should be explicit about doing so. Note that some of 
              these are exceptions to the policy above in that they do cause non-explicit priority passes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their first main phase, the non-active 
                player is assumed to be acting in beginning of combat unless they are affecting whether a beginning 
                of combat ability triggers. Then, after those actions resolve or no actions took place, the active player 
                receives priority at the beginning of combat. 
                Beginning of combat triggered abilities (even ones that target) may be announced at this time.</li>
          <li>If the active player passes priority with an empty stack during their second main phase or uses a 
                phrase such as “Go” or “Your Turn” at any time, the non-active player is assumed to be acting in the 
                end step unless they are affecting how or whether an end of turn ability triggers. End of turn triggered 
                abilities that do not target resolve after the non-active player passes priority.</li>
          <li>Whenever a player adds an object to the stack, they are assumed to be passing priority unless they 
                explicitly announce that they intend to retain it.</li>
          <li>If a player adds a group of objects to the stack without explicitly retaining priority, they are assumed 
                to be adding them to the stack individually and allowing each to resolve before adding the next. If 
                another player wishes to take an action at a point in the middle of this sequence, the actions should be 
                reversed to that point.</li>
          <li>If a player casts a spell or activates an ability and announces choices for it that are not normally made 
                until resolution, the player must adhere to those choices unless an opponent responds to that spell or 
                ability. If an opponent inquires about choices made during resolution, that player is assumed to be 
                passing priority and allowing that spell or ability to resolve.</li>
          <li>A player is assumed to have paid any cost of 0 unless they announce otherwise.</li>
          <li>A player who casts a spell or activates an ability that targets an object on the stack is assumed to 
                target the legal spell closest to the top of the stack unless the player specifies otherwise.</li>
          <li>A player is assumed to be attacking another player with their creatures and not any planeswalkers that 
                player may control unless the attacking player specifies otherwise.</li>
          <li>A player who does not scry/surveil when instructed to is assumed to have not looked and chosen to leave the cards in the 
                same order.</li>
          <li>In the Two-Headed Giant format, attacking creatures are assumed to be attacking the head of the 
                defending player sitting directly across from their controller, unless the creature's controller specifies 
                otherwise.</li>

      <h3 class='panel-title' data-toggle='collapse' data-target="#section43">4.3 Out-of-Order Sequencing</h3>

      <div id="section43" class='collapse'>
        <p>Due to the complexity of accurately representing a game of Magic, it is acceptable for players to engage in a 
              block of actions that, while technically in an incorrect order, arrive at a legal and clearly understood game state 
              once they are complete.</p>

        <p>All actions taken must be legal if they were executed in the correct order, and any opponent can ask the player to 
              do the actions in the correct sequence so that they can respond at the appropriate time (at which point players will 
              not be held to any still-pending actions).</p>

        <p>An out-of-order sequence must not result in a player prematurely gaining information which could reasonably 
              affect decisions made later in that sequence.</p>

        <p>Players may not try to use opponent's reactions to some portion of an out-of-order sequence to see if they should 
              modify actions or try to take additional ones. Nor may players use out-of-order sequencing to try to retroactively 
              take an action they missed at the appropriate time. In general, any substantial pause at the end of a completed 
              batch is an indication that all actions have been taken, the sequence is complete and the game has moved to the 
              appropriate point at the end of the sequence.</p>

        <h5>Examples</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>A player discards a card to pay for Masticore’s upkeep cost before untapping their land.</li>
          <li>A player resolves Harrow and puts the card into their graveyard, then searches.</li>
          <li>While resolving Restore Balance, a player discards before sacrificing lands and creatures.</li>
          <li>A player with two creatures being put into the graveyard due to state-based actions resolves the
                leaves-the-battlefield triggered ability on one of them before putting the other creature in the 
                graveyard.</li>
          <li>A player declares a blocker, animates a Treetop Village, and then attempts to block with that Treetop 
                Village.</li>

      <div id="section44" class='collapse'>
        <p>A loop is a form of tournament shortcut that involves detailing a sequence of actions to be repeated and then 
              performing a number of iterations of that sequence. The loop actions must be identical in each iteration and 
              cannot include conditional actions ("If this, then that".)</p>

        <p>If no players are involved in maintaining the loop, each player in turn order chooses a number of iterations to 
              perform before they will take an action to break the loop or that they wish to take no action. If all players choose 
              to take no action, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances through the lowest number of iterations 
              chosen and the player who chose that number takes an action to break the loop.</p>

        <p>If one player is involved in maintaining the loop, they choose a number of iterations. The other players, in turn 
              order, agree to that number or announce a lower number after which they intend to intervene. The game advances 
              through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority.</p>

        <p>If two or more players are involved in maintaining a loop within a turn, each player in turn order chooses a 
              number of iterations to perform. The game advances through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the 
              player who chose that number receives priority.</p>

        <p>Loops may span multiple turns if a game state is not meaningfully changing. Note that drawing cards other than 
              the ones being used to sustain the loop is a meaningful change. If two or more players are involved in maintaining 
              a loop across turns, each player chooses a number of iterations to perform, or announces their intent to continue 
              indefinitely. If all players choose to continue indefinitely, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game advances 
              through the lowest number of iterations chosen and the player who chose that number receives priority at the 
              point they stop taking an action to sustain the loop.</p>

        <p>A player intervening during a loop may specify that one iteration of the loop is only partly performed in order to 
              be able to take action at the appropriate point. If they do, the final iteration is only performed up to the chosen 
              point.</p>

        <p>Non-deterministic loops (loops that rely on decision trees, probability or mathematical convergence) may not be 
              shortcut. A player attempting to execute a nondeterministic loop must stop if at any point during the process a 
              previous game state (or one identical in all relevant ways) is reached again. This happens most often in loops that 
              involve shuffling a library.</p>

        <p>Some loops are sustained by choices rather than actions. In these cases, the rules above may be applied, with
              the player making a different choice rather than ceasing to take an action. The game moves to the point where the player
              makes that choice. If the choice involves hidden information, a judge may be needed to determine whether any choice is
              available that will not continue the loop.</p>

        <p>The judge is the final arbiter of what constitutes a loop. A player may not 'opt-out' of shortcutting a loop, nor may 
              they make irrelevant changes between iterations in an attempt to make it appear as though there is no loop. Once a 
              loop has been shortcut, it may not be restarted until the game has changed in a relevant way. Proposing loops as 
              an effort to use up time on the clock is Stalling.</p>

      <div id="section47" class='collapse'>
        <p>Players in Competitive and Professional Rules Enforcement Level matches must arrange their cards, tokens, and 
              other accessories on the battlefield using the following layout:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>From the player’s perspective, nonlands must be kept closer to the player’s opponent than lands, and 
                no non-land cards should be between the land area and the edge of the table closest to the player.</li>
          <li>Non-creature permanents whose use may reasonably be associated with either the land or nonland 
                area (e.g. an artifact whose only ability is a mana ability) may be located in either area, provided the 
                overall layout is, in the judgment of tournament officials, clear. However, permanents that are also 
                creatures (e.g. artifacts with March of the Machines on the battlefield, Dryad Arbor, or a Treetop 
                Village that is currently a creature) must be placed in the nonland area. Players may not use other 
                cards to intentionally obscure the presence of a permanent in any area of the battlefield.</li>
          <li>Each card should remain clearly associated with any permanents attached to it. For example, an Aura 
                enchanting a land should be in the land area in contact with that land.</li>
          <li>The player’s library, graveyard, and exiled cards should be kept all to the left of the battlefield or all 
                to the right of the battlefield at the player’s discretion.</li>
          <li>The player’s graveyard and exiled cards should be adjacent to the player’s library. All three should be 
                distinct at all times.</li>
          <li>If a card is exiled by a permanent and that permanent includes a way to perform additional actions 
                with the exiled card, the association of the two cards must be clear. Keeping the two cards together is 
                recommended.</li>
          <li>Each untapped permanent should face its controller. Players are permitted to briefly turn a card 
                upside-down as a memory aid.</li>
          <li>Physical objects used to represent permanents must have a way of clearly representing any in-game status, such as
                whether a permanet is tapped. Sleeves or card backs that appear similar to any player's sleeves or card backs may not 
                be used. the Head Judge is the final authority on what may be used to represent permanents.</li>
          <li>Tournament officials may make exceptions or additions to these guidelines at their sole discretion in order to keep 
                each player’s game layout clear. Players in exceptional situations (e.g. a player playing a deck with no lands or a 
                deck that makes significant use of the graveyard) should consult with tournament officials to determine what 
                allowances, if any, will be made.</li>

      <div id="section48" class='collapse'>
        <p>Players are expected to consider their options before taking an action and players are not usually allowed to take 
              back an action that has been communicated to their opponent, either verbally or physically.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, a player will realize that they have made a wrong decision after making a play. If that player has not 
              gained any information since taking the action and they wish to make a different decision, a judge may allow that 
              player to change their mind. Judges must carefully consider whether the player has gained information since 
              making the play that might have affected the decision; in particular, players may not try to use opponent reactions 
              (or lack thereof) to see if they should modify actions they committed to. If the judge cannot be sure no 
              information was gained, they should not allow the decision to be changed.</p>

        <p>Teammates intervening before information has been gained is acceptable when considering a backup.</p>

        <h5>Examples</h5>

        <ol>
          <li>A player plays an Island and, before anything else happens, says “Sorry, I meant to play a Swamp.”</li>
          <li>A player says “No blocks” immediately followed by “Wait, no, I block with this creature.”</li>

      <div id="section52" class='collapse'>
        <p>The decision to drop, concede, or agree to an intentional draw cannot be made in exchange for or influenced by 
              the offer of any reward or incentive, nor may any in-game decision be influenced in this manner. Making such an 
              offer or enticing someone into making an offer is prohibited and is considered bribery. 
              Players may not make any offers to tournament 
              officials in an attempt to influence the outcome of a ruling.</p>

        <p>It is not bribery when players share prizes they have not yet received in the current tournament and they may 
              agree to such before or during their match, as long as any such sharing does not occur in exchange for any game 
              or match result or the dropping of a player from the tournament.</p>

        <p>It is not bribery when players in the announced last round of the single-elimination portion of a tournament agree 
              to a winner and how to divide the subsequent tournament prizes. In that case, one of the players at each table must 
              agree to drop from the tournament. Players receive the prizes according to their final ranking.</p>

        <p>The result of a match or game may not be randomly or arbitrarily determined through any means other than the 
              normal progress of the game in play. Examples include (but are not limited to) rolling a die, flipping a coin, arm 
              wrestling, or playing any other game.</p>

        <p>Players may not reach an agreement in conjunction with other matches. Players can make use of information 
             regarding match or game scores of other tables. However, players are not allowed to leave their seats during their 
             match or go to great lengths to obtain this information.</p>

        <p>Players in the single-elimination rounds of a tournament offering only cash, store credit, prize tickets, and/or 
              unopened product as prizes may, with the permission of the Tournament Organizer, agree to split the prizes 
              evenly. The players may end the tournament at that point or continue to play. All players still in the tournament 
              must agree to the arrangement.</p>

        <p>Example: Before the semifinals of a tournament (in which first place gets 12 packs, second place gets 8 packs and 
              3rd and 4th get 4 packs each) begins, the players may get permission from the Tournament Organizer to end the 
              tournament, with each player receiving 7 packs.</p>

        <p>Example: In the finals of a 1-slot Players Tour Qualifier that offers a travel award and an invitation to the 
              winner, the two finalists may agree to split the tournament prizes, but this agreement cannot alter the results of the 
              match. One player must drop from the tournament, leaving the travel award and the invitation to the player who 
              did not drop from the tournament. That player is then free to split the remainder of the prizes as agreed upon. The 
              travel award and invitation are a single item and may not be split.</p>

      <div id="section76" class='collapse'>
        <p>For Booster Draft and Team Rochester Draft tournaments, players assemble into random drafting circles (called 
              pods) of roughly equal size at the direction of the Head Judge. Tournament officials then distribute identical sets 
              of draft boosters to each player.</p>

        <p>Players within a pod may play only against other players within that pod. In Regular Rules Enforcement Level 
              tournaments, the Tournament Organizer may elect to lift this restriction. This must be announced before the

      <div id="section77" class='collapse'>
        <p>All players must open and draft the same type of draft booster at the same time. Players open their first booster pack 
              and count the cards face down, removing token cards, rules cards, and any other non-game cards. Players who 
              receive an erroneous number of cards at any time must immediately notify a judge. Players choose one card from their 
              current booster pack and then pass the remaining cards face down to the player on their left until all cards are 
              drafted. (Exception: When the Booster Draft consists of <i>Double Masters</i> draft boosters, players choose two cards for their first pick from each draft booster. All other Booster Draft rules remain the same). Once a player has removed a card from the pack and put it on top of their single, front face-down drafted 
              pile, it is considered selected and may not be returned to the pack.</p>

        <p>Players may not reveal the front face of their card selections or the contents of their current packs to other 
              participants in the draft and must make a reasonable effort to keep that information from the sight of other 
              players. Players are not permitted to reveal hidden information of any kind to other participants in the draft 
              regarding their own picks or what they want others to pick. (Exception: This does not apply to double-faced cards, 
              both faces of which may be revealed at any time during a draft.)</p>

        <p>Players and teams may not look at their drafted cards between or during picks at Competitive and Professional 
              Rules Enforcement Levels. At Regular Rules Enforcement Level, players are allowed to review their drafted cards 
              between or during picks as long as they are holding no other cards at the same time. The Head Judge may choose 
              to disallow this provided they announce it before the first draft. Between boosters there is a review period in 
              which players may review their picks.</p>

        <p>If the draft is not being timed, and two players do not wish to make a pick before the other player, the player 
              closer to providing the other player with the pack picks first. If the players are equidistant, then the player in the 
              lower seat number picks first.</p>

        <p>After the first pack is drafted and the review period completed, players open the next pack and draft in the same 
              fashion, except that the direction of drafting is reversed—it now proceeds to the right. This process is repeated, 
              reversing the direction of drafting for each booster pack until all cards in all booster packs are drafted.</p>

        <p>If a player is unable or unwilling to continue drafting, but wishes to remain in the tournament, they are suspended 
              from drafting and must construct a deck from whatever cards they have drafted thus far. For the remainder of the 
              draft, their picks are skipped and the draft continues with one fewer player.</p>

      <div id="section82" class='collapse'>
        <p>A valid team consists of two or three members, as appropriate to the format. A team is identified by the individual 
              DCI membership numbers of its respective members and all teams must provide the Tournament Organizer with 
              the full information when registering for the tournament. Individuals may be members of more than one team, 
              though not during the same tournament. If a player drops or is disqualified from the tournament, the entire team is 
              dropped from the tournament. If a player is disqualified from the tournament, the entire team is disqualified
              from the tournament.</p>

        <p>Teams must designate player positions during tournament registration. For example, in a three-player team 
              tournament, each team must designate who is player A, player B, and player C. Players retain these designations 
              throughout the entire tournament.</p>

        <p>When two teams are paired against each other during the course of a tournament, the team members designated as 
              “player A” play against each other, the team members designated as “player B” play against each other, and so on.</p>

              no other player on that team may use Naturalize in their deck.) No players may use cards that are banned in a particular 
              format. Cards that override deck construction rules (i.e. Relentless Rats) may only override them for 
              one deck on a team.</p>

      <div id="section85" class='collapse'>
        <p>Team Rochester Draft tournaments require teams of three players each. Two teams are seated at each table for the 
              draft. Team members sit clockwise in A-B-C order around the table. (For example, in a three-person team 
              tournament, players sit around the table clockwise in this order: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C.)</p>

        <p>A team determined at random chooses either to pick first or to allow the other team to pick first. Player B of the 
              team that picks first lays out the first pack.</p>

        <p>The draft begins with the first player opening their first draft booster and laying out the entire contents of the pack 
              face up on the table as directed by tournament officials, with the cards facing them. After reviewing the cards, 
              drafting proceeds with each player selecting a single card in turn. Once a player has selected a card and placed it 
              with their other drafted cards, they may not select a different card. If a player fails to select a card in the time 
              given, a tournament official selects for that player the “oldest” card remaining from the booster pack (the card on 
              the table the longest).</p>

        <p>The player drafting first from the cards presented on the table is called the active player. The first active player is 
              the participant who opened the first booster pack of the draft, as designated by a tournament official. All players in 
              each drafting pod serve as the active player once for each group of booster packs. The identity of the active player 
              moves in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third booster packs and counter-clockwise for the second. The 
              player who was last to open a booster pack from a group is the first to open the booster pack from the next group.</p>

        <p>The draft order also begins moving in a horseshoe pattern, clockwise for the first and third boosters and counter-
              clockwise for the second, beginning with the active player, continuing around the table to the last player in the 
              group to draft a card. The last player in the group selects two cards sequentially, and then drafting continues in 
              reverse order, moving back to the player who began the drafting. If there are still cards remaining, the player who 
              began the drafting selects two cards, and drafting continues again in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p>Example: Team 1 and Team 2 are seated around a table. They are numbered 1A-1B-1C-2A-2B-2C in a clockwise 
              order. Team 2 wins the coin toss, and the members of Team 2 choose to let Team 1 pick first. The active player 
              for the first pack is Player 1B. The first booster pack for Player 1B is opened and placed face up in front of Player 
              1B. After the 20-second review period has expired, the draft order is as follows:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Player 1B—card 1</td>  <td>Player 1A—card 6</td>  <td>Player 1C—card 11</td>
          </tr>
        <tr><td>Player 1C—card 2</td>  <td>Player 1A—card 7</td>  <td>Player 1B—card 12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Player 2A—card 3</td>  <td>Player 2C—card 8</td>  <td>Player 1B—card 13</td></tr> 
        <tr><td>Player 2B—card 4</td>  <td>Player 2B—card 9</td>  <td>Player 1C—card 14</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Player 2C—card 5</td>  <td>Player 2A—card 10</td>  <td>Player 2A—card 15</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>During card selection, players must display the most recent card they drafted from the current pack. At all other 
              times, players may leave one of their drafted cards face up on their draft pile or may leave all cards face down. 
              Players may not review their draft picks while drafting proceeds or at any other time specifically indicated by 
              tournament officials.</p>

      <div id="section104" class='collapse'>
        <p>Unless otherwise announced, tournaments are assumed to follow the Swiss pairing algorithm. Some tournaments 
              may proceed to single-elimination playoff rounds between the top 2, 4, or 8 (or other number) players after the 
              Swiss rounds are over. The Swiss pairing algorithm is modified in Booster Draft tournaments as explained in 
              section 7.6.</p>

        <p>For constructed tournaments that have a single-elimination playoff (or sealed deck tournaments that do not use a 
              booster draft for the playoff), the recommended pairing method is to pair the playoff players by the final Swiss 
              standings.</p>

        <p>For an 8-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 8th place player, the 2nd place player plays the 7th place 
              player, the 3rd place player plays the 6th place player, and the 4th place player plays the 5th place player. The 
              winners of the 1st/8th place and 4th/5th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners 
              of the 2nd/7th place and 3rd/6th place matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The remaining 
              players play in the last round of the playoff.</p>

        <p>For a 4-player playoff, the 1st place player plays the 4th place player, and the 2nd place player plays the 3rd place 
              player. The remaining players play in the last round of the playoff.</p>

        <p>For Limited tournaments that have a single-elimination booster draft playoff, it is recommend that only an 8-
              player playoff is run using the following method described below.</p>

        <p>Use a random method to seat players around the draft table and conduct the draft.</p>

        <p>After the draft has concluded, the player in seat 1 plays the player in seat 5, the player in seat 2 plays the player in 
              seat 6, the player in seat 3 plays the player in seat 7, and the player in seat 4 plays the player in seat 8. The 
              winners of the seat 1/5 and the 3/7 matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The winners of the 
              seat 2/6 and the seat 4/8 matches play each other in the next round of the playoff. The remaining players play in 
              the last round of the playoff.</p>

        <p>For most Premier Events, the playoff options above are required, not optional.</p>

        <p>Premier Events include the following tournaments: Magic: The Gathering World Championship, Players Tour, Players Tour Finals, WPN Qualifiers, WPN Preliminary Events, Players Tour Qualifiers, Magic Premier Series, Grand Prix, and Grand Prix Trials.</p>

        <p>Exception: Grand Prix Trials and Players Tour Qualifiers that are run at MagicFest events have special structures. Participants in Grand Prix Trials or Players Tour Qualifiers at MagicFest events should refer to the fact sheet for a MagicFest event for information on the structure of those tournaments.</p>
